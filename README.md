# Native Android Firebase C.R.U.D

- To use this project it's necessary to previously have a collection in firebase called "articulos" or name it whatever you want but then you'll need to change the code to correspond to that collection ðŸ˜„

- Also `google-services.json` file is needed, that's a private file, so you'll need to generate your own based on your firebase project.
